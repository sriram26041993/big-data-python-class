    "Python provides two built-in functions to read a line of text from standard input, which by default comes from the keyboard. These functions are raw_input and input.\n",
    "The raw_input([prompt]) function reads one line from standard input and returns it as a string\n",
    "The input([prompt]) function is equivalent to raw_input, except that it assumes the input is a valid Python expression and returns the evaluated result to you.\n",
    "Python provides basic functions and methods necessary to manipulate files by default. You can do most of the file manipulation using a file object.\n",
    "\n",
    "open():Before you can read or write a file, you have to open it using Python's built-in open() function. This function creates a file object, which would be utilized to call other support methods associated with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "close():The close() method of a file object flushes any unwritten information and closes the file object, after which no more writing can be done.Python automatically closes a file when the reference object of a file is reassigned to another file. It is a good practice to use the close() method to close a file.\n",

    "if from= 0, it means use the beginning of the file as the reference position \n",
    "if from= 1, it means use the current position as the reference position \n",
